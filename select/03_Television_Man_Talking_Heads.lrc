[00:16.12] I'm looking and I'm dreaming for the first time
[00:40.21] I'm inside and I'm outside at the same time
[00:47.62] And everything is real
[00:52.39] Do I like the way I feel?
[01:04.89] 
[00:56.27] When the world crashes in into my living room
[00:59.95] Television man made me what I am
[01:04.44] People like to put the television down
[01:08.22] But we are just good friends
[01:11.45] (I'm a) television man
[01:22.45] 
[01:32.50] I knew a girl, she was a macho man
[01:40.18] But it's alright, I wasn't fooled for long
[01:48.46] This is the place for me
[01:52.18] I'm the king, and you're the queen
[02:09.18] 
[01:56.14] CHORUS
[01:59.14] 
[02:18.28] Take a walk in the beautiful garden
[02:21.13] Everyone would like to say hello
[02:24.65] It doesn't matter what you say
[02:28.46] Come and take us away
[02:38.96] 
[04:42.01] The world crashes in, into my living room
[04:48.85] The world crashes in, into my living room
[04:56.25] The world crashes in, into my living room
[05:04.63] The world crashes in, into my living room
[05:25.13] 
[05:12.38] And we are still good friends...(Television man)
[05:16.74] I'm watching everything...(Television man)
[05:21.09] Television man...(Television man)
[05:24.72] I'm watching everything...(Television man)
[05:28.34] Television man... and I'm gonna say
[05:32.78] We are still good friends... and I'm trying to be
[05:36.85] Watchin' everything... and I gotta say
[05:40.53] We are still good friends... You know the way it is
[05:45.33] Television man... I've got what you need
[05:48.68] We are still good friends... I know the way you are
[05:52.75] Television man... I know what you're tryin' to be
[05:56.95] Watchin' everything... and I gotta say
[06:00.97] That's how the story ends.
